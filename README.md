# Machine-Learning-Based-Disease-Prediction-using-Kaggle-Dataset

Developed and implemented a machine learning pipeline for disease prediction using algorithms such as KNN and Decision Trees. Responsibilities included data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation using techniques like cross-validation and accuracy metrics. Utilized Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib to visualize and determine the best model. Managed imbalanced datasets, employed Label Encoding for categorical variables, and designed custom hyper-parameter tuning to enhance model performance.
